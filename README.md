# Celestial-Object-Detection
Astronomy is one such discipline with an abundance of vast datasets, and machine learning algorithms are sometimes a necessity due to the labor intensity of analyzing all this data and deriving insights and conclusions in a more manual fashion.
The objective of the project is to use the tabular features available to us about every astronomical object, to predict whether the object is a star, a galaxy or a quasar, through the use of supervised machine learning methods.
